            <h3 ">VISUAL CREATIVITY</h3>
            <P>There's more visual freedom in parallax website design, Rather than <br>
                focusing on block style information architecture,you can create <br>
                refreshing and engaging visuals such as animation or beautifual <br>
                photography, that act as a continum,ultimately inspiring users to <br>
                scroll further down the page.</P>

                Do you want to tell a story with your product or service? <br>
                 Long-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative and <br>
                 encourages meaningful interaction from users <br>

            <h1 >SIMPLE INTERFACE FOR</h1>
            <span >SMART DEVICE USERS</span> <br>
            <P>Mobile and tablets have evolved the way we engage in website. it's <br>
                 now less about clicking and more about scrolling ,swiping and tapping, <br>
                 long-scrolling websites  take away the barrier of complex navigation, <br>
                 providing a responsive, user-friendly experience for mobile users.</P>

            <h1>PUNCHY, STRAIGHT TO</h1>
            <span >THE POINT MESSAGING</span> <br>
            <p>
                Parallex website design is a grate solution for us time-poor <br>
                website browsers,as it forces business to convey their <br>
                message and vision into one dynamic web design page. <br>
            </p>
        </div>

            <h1 >TASIER FOR USERS TO </h1>
            <span>REALISE THEIR GOAL</span> <br>
            <p>There days,scrolling is so simple that it's become an <br>
                instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page <br>
                 requiers thought and motivation. A single page website <br>
                  allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker, <br>
                   than needing to site through multiple pages.</p>

            <h3 ">YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVVY</h3> <br>
            <p>One of the biggest problems that parallex websites face is that <br>
                they are not SEO friendly.why?when you limit the number of <br>
                pages in your website, Google has fewer pages to index and <br>
                negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results <br>
                 page(SERP).Luckily there are ways around this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="con8">
            <h1 >SLOWER LOAD TIMES </h1>
            <p>
                50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the <br>
                 more high resolution imagery and animations you include, yhe longer it takes to <br>
                 load the pages. when writing this article,we tested some popular parallax <br>
                 websites, and found that the ones with complex visuals took up to <br>
                  30 seconds to load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites <br>
                   loaded within a few seconds.

                AWKWARD NAVIGATION
            </h1>
            <pa >
                Instead of hitting the "back" button, users must scroll back <br>
                 up the page which can be frustrating for users who want to <br>
                 refer back to a certain element. An easy way around this is <br>
                 to include top navigation and have each element anchored <br>
                 to a category or section
